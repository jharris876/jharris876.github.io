                    <h5>Bachelor of Computer Science</h5>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Jacob Harris. I am a recent graduate from Tennessee Technological University. 
                        In school I was able to work in a fast paced and team oriented environment. In my senior year my 
                        team and I worked through 6 iterations using the SCRUM development process to create a master application 
                        for the TANF(Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) Opportunity Act. As a team we were given backend access to research multiple 
                        government applications to reduce redundancies for applicants. Every week we met with our customer to ensure we met their needs 
                        through out our development process. At the end of the project we derived a master application that is being used by a vendor 
                        to develop a full application without redundancies for TANF Act applicants. I am very passionate about making organized, quality 
                        work and I strive to make clean and readable code with any project. I can easily communicate with anyone on a team and be a mentor 
                        when I can. When I'm not working I enjoy playing video games, working out, playing basketball and spending time with friends.
